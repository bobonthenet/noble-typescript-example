# noble-typescript-example

Simplified example of the problem I'm having with the Noble library with Typescript.

Some initial setup is required for getting the BLE stuff to work. See the repo for the noble package and follow the steps for your OS.

Once you've completed the above:
``` 
npm install 
npx tsc
node ./built/app
```
